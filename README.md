This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R's subsetting mechanism.  When a logical vector used for subsetting a data frame is longer than the number of rows in the frame, R silently truncates the logical vector without issuing a warning. This can lead to hard-to-debug errors. The `bug.R` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.R` provides a solution to mitigate this issue.
